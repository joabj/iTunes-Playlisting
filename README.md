# iTunes-Playlisting

This program can write out all the songs played in iTunes over any given time period, the default being once a month.
There is also a command-line interactive version, though you have to remove it out of comments to work. 

The small Shell script also included activate the program to run against the previous month. The main program
is written in Perl. There is also a sample HTML file here. 

This is an incredibly janky program was written years ago. This could even be one of the worst programs 
even written, for I know (which is not much). It doesn't even parse the (crazy-ass) XML scheme, but 
just brute-forces through it, using the XML for brute-force pattern recognition. It is speedy, I'll give it that.

You can see the results of its monthly churn here: http://joabj.com/Data/Music/
